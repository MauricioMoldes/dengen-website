# DenGen Website

Welcome to the **DenGen Website**, the official front-end portal for the Danish national genomic database **DenGen**. This site provides accessible information about aggregated variant frequencies from whole-genome sequencing of the Danish population, helping researchers and clinicians interpret genetic data in a population-specific context.

---

## Project Overview

DenGen is a comprehensive dataset of genetic variants collected from thousands of unrelated Danish individuals. The website serves as an informational hub and gateway to dynamic features like genome browsers and variant beacons, all designed to support genomics research and clinical diagnostics.

---

## Features

- **Static informational pages** about the DenGen project, dataset, methodology, and contributors.
- **Integration with genome browsers** and variant beacon services.
- Clean, responsive UI built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.
- Easily extendable front end to accommodate future features and data visualizations.
- Powered by the infrastructure and design principles of the **gnomAD browser**.

---

## Technology Stack
